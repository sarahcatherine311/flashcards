# FlashCards 

## Abstract
In this project I contributed code to an partially constructed object-oriented application to make a working application. I implemented ES6 classes and wrote modular, reusable code that follows SRP (Single Responsibility Principle). Through TDD (Test Driven Development) I implemented a robus testing suite.

In this application, a user will be able to see questions, take guesses, and see a final score at the end of the round.
